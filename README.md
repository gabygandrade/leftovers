# Leftovers 
A small web app boostrapped with Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) created to help you make use of your leftovers. Search by ingredients and find recipes to inspire you to never throw away your leftovers again!

## Running Locally
To run this app locally you will first need to create an account with the [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/) to obtain your API key and App id. Then, replace the dummy values with your actual API key and App id in `/src/keys.js` file. Once that is complete:

- **Clone the project**: `git clone https://github.com/gabygandrade/leftovers.git`
- **Install packages**: `npm i`
- **Run the app**: `npm start`
- **Test**: `npm test`
