Steps:

* Watch Thinking In React to make sure I have components structure correct 

1) Get it to MVP
    - add search for recipes 
    - add routing - when search, it leads to /results page 
    - results page displays the results as a grid.
        Decide: Flexbox vs Boostrap vs CSS Grid 
    - make the recipe's look good 
    - when click on the recipe, route user to other page /recipe/id

2) Make it Pretty
    1. React - bootstrap

3) Optimize
    1. Add CSS Modules instead of stylesheets: https://codeburst.io/4-four-ways-to-style-react-components-ac6f323da822
    2. Consider Axios instead? 

4) Add Redux?

5) Build basic backend 
    1. store API Key: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46838015/using-api-keys-in-a-react-app

Add TypeScript or Flow 

**Document tradeoffs and issues I came across **

TO DO BEFORE TALK:
// explain lifecycle methods
// explain layout from -

FUTURE:
- route to a new /results page when search - will need Redux to do this
- figure out why images flicker when placed on the page
